# ECS

A sandbox fun place to learn ECS by making one.  This is not a great system
and should not be used by anyone, but it's been great for learning!  For example,
the data isn't stored in contiguous memory, and does a full iteration on all
systems instead of using optimized caches.  I may return to fix these later,
but it's Fast Enough (tm) for now and gets the concepts across for usage.

Licenses are included in the license subdirectory for the sample project.

Uses [Catch](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) for unit testing.
